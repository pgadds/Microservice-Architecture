Case 23 Microservicesare developed with an idea on developers mind to create small services, with each having their own functionality. But, breaking an application into small autonomous units has to be done logically. So, to 
decompose a small or big application into small services, you can use the DecompositionpatternsThis case study will cover the different classes of Microservice patterns includingthe decomposition patterns.  Layout all the different patterns and do critical analysis in your own words to analysis those patterns in terms of real coding, deployment or composition of microservices.
I'd like to learn about decompisition patterns and learn more about the little building blocks that make a microservice. I'm fascinated by patters and the fact that microservices have patterns of their own is something that is very interesting to me.
