The first thing I noticed when I opened the Gartner report was the first line which I assumed to be the thesis. 
The Thesis stated that Microservices "enable unprecedented agility and scalability, but the architecture causes significant cultural disruption". 
This first line of the report immediately peaked my interest. It left me wondering what microservices were and how they  were able to be so effective 
and yet so different from the norm to a point where it would be considered a "cultural disruption". As I continued reading I began to understand 
that Microservices entailed significant investment in people, processes, and platforms which included highly skilled application architects and DevOps 
practitioners as well as a new means of data management and analytics. The definition of a microservice is a tightly scoped, strongly encapsulated, 
loosely coupled, independently deployable and independently scalable application component. The result of this is that small (refering to scope) and 
independent deployments occur which in turn allows for scalability, flexibility, productivity, and faster development. This continuous delivery and improvement
methodology made for why earlier in the reading Microservices were seen as a significant cultural disrupt in an industry that sterotypically takes 
extended periods of time to impliment changes. I recently got my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification and thought it would be appropriate to mention 
that many of the concepts highlighted in this article were also spelled out in the AWS Well-Architected Framework (Operational Excellence, Security, 
Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization).
